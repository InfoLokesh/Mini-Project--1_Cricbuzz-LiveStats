    Create a comprehensive performance ranking system for players. Combine their batting performance (runs scored, batting average, strike rate), bowling performance (wickets taken, bowling average, economy rate), and fielding performance (catches, stumpings) into a single weighted score. Use this formula and rank players:
    ● Batting points: (runs_scored × 0.01) + (batting_average × 0.5) + (strike_rate × 0.3)
    ● Bowling points: (wickets_taken × 2) + (50 - bowling_average) × 0.5) + ((6 - economy_rate) × 2)
    Rank the top performers in each cricket format.

    ● Average victory margin when each team wins
    ● Performance when batting first vs bowling first at different venues
    ● Overall win percentage for each team in this head-to-head record
